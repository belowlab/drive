# Using Pip to install IBDCluster: 
___
DRIVE v1.0.0 has been official released on PYPI ([DRIVE pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/drive-ibd/))! The software can be installed using the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
pip install drive-ibd
{% endhighlight %}


{: .warning }
***Warning about supported python versions:***<br>
DRIVE has only been tested with python >= 3.6.13 and python <= 3.9. These are currently the only supported python versions. The recommend way to install DRIVE using pip would be to either create a virtual environment using [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Once you activate the virtual environment then you can use the above pip command to install DRIVE into an isolated environment.
