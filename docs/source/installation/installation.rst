DRIVE Installation
==================

DRIVE has several installation options. Pip installation is the most straightfoward way for individuals who just wish to use the DRIVE cli without having to install any dependencies. Individuals who wish to contribute to DRIVE need to clone the repository from Github. Individuals who need to use DRIVE in a cloud environment or an a HPC that doesn't allow PIP can use the docker installation.
