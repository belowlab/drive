Contributing
============

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development of DRIVE! If you have no idea where to start, you can read the how to contribute to drive section. We do ask that you also read the rules about formatting and become familiar with some of the development tools that developers are expected to use to maintain coding styles.

.. important::

   Due to the nature of academia, DRIVE has to maintain moderate backwards compatiblity and be very explicit when backwards compatiblity is broken. For this reason all DRIVE code has to use syntax compatible with the oldest acceptable version of Python. Sometimes this means very helpful updated language features can't be used. We ask that whenever any contributions that break backwards compatiblity are introduced, you explicit mention how it is breaking compatibility and you use appropriate versioning to indicate the change.
