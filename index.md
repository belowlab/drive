Distant Relatedness for Identification and Variant Evaluation (DRIVE) is a novel approach to IBD-based genotype inference used to identify shared chromosomal segments in dense genetic arrays. DRIVE implemented a random walk algorithm that identifies clusters of individuals who pairwise share an IBD segment overlapping a locus of interest. This tool was developed in python by the Below Lab at Vanderbilt University.
