# Welcome to the IBDCluster Documentation!
---

IBDCluster is a CLI python program designed to utilize IBD sharing within BioBanks to cluster individuals and then perform phenotypic enrichment tests for each cluster. This project is maintained by the Below Laboratory in the Vanderbilt Genetics Department.

## Goal behind this website documentation:
---
This website serves as one of the documentation sources for the IBDCluster project. This documentation is not meant to be technically documentation, meaning it will not necessary explain all of the models used, nor the relationship between class, etc. Instead it is meant to be geared to people who wish to install and run the program. If you wish to contribute to the software or understand the more technical design of the project then wed would encourage you to view the github README which has more technical details.
